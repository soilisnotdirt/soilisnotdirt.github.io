			<p class="flip" onclick="myFunction()">What is Soil?</p>
			<div id="fact"> <p> Soil, which makes up the pedosphere, is where the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and atmosphere interact. It is a dynamic ecosystem and is the most complex biological material on Earth. It is 25% air, 25% water, 45% mineral particles, and 5% organic matter, which consists of organisms, roots, and humus. Soil is an integral component of biogeochemical cycling that performs 5 essential functions essential to earth's sustainability. </p> </div>

			<p class="flip2" onclick="myFunction2()">What are the major functions of soil?</p><div id="fact2"> <p> Soil sustains life above and below surface. Soil regulates and partitions water and solute flow. Soil  filters, buffers, degrades, immobilizes, and detoxifies. Soil also stores and cycles nutrients, and provides support to structures.</p> </div> 		

			<p class="flip3" onclick="myFunction3()">What are the factors that influence soil formation?</p>
			<div id="fact3"> <p>Soil processes include addition, losses, transformation, translocation.
			climate: long term temperature and precipitation, chemical and physical weathering
			organisms: microbes, plants, and animals that add, decompose, or mix organic matter and soil particles
			relief (topography): shape, elevation, slope and aspect of landscape
			parent material: material from which a soil develops, there are three types - organic deposits, residual, and transported (transported can be from marine or glacial, gravity, or wind)
			time: soil formation is a continuous series of processes that take time - it takes 100-1000s of years to form 1 inch of soil. time has the GREATEST INFLUENCE on soil morphology TIME CREATES EARTH HISTORY
			anthropogenic factor: we can move and relocate massive amounts of soil material through technology.</p> </div>
			
			<p class="flip4" onclick="myFunction4()">What is the need for soil conservation (sustaining soil resources) ?</p>
			<div id="fact4"> <p>Soil conservation is necessary as the amount of soil on the Earth increases very slowly, and may hundreds to thousands of years to generate one inch of soil. On the other hand, soil is quickly lost through erosion and anthropogenic factors. Soil is the basis of life and crucial for many aspects of human life as it provides food, filters air and water and helps to decompose biological waste into nutrients for new plant life. Without soil, there would be no life!</p> </div>

			<p class="flip5" onclick="myFunction5()"> What can individuals do to improve soil quality/health? </p>
			<div id="fact5"> <p> <li>Before planting, know the soil's pH level </li>
				<li> Get your soil tested to find out its nutrient levels </li>
				<li> ID your soil type</li>
				<li> Feeding your soil: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium </li>
				<li> Living organisms are crucial to healthy soil (ex. Worms, fungus) </li>
				<li> Be careful of pesticides and fertilizer because it can interfere with the balance of nature in soil (Use organic fertilizers) </li>
				<li> Choose plants that work well for your soil </li>
